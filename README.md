The project - 'CURECRAFT' is based on a Sustainable Development Goal - 'Good Health and Well-Being'. This website was created by Team SIGMA. It's a GDSC Solution Challenge. Team SIGMA - Vijay Guttula - Front-End Vamshi Krishna - Back-End Gokul P - UI, UX and R&D We created this website mainly using HTML and CSS (for Front-End), and Javascript (for Back-End). We used UI, UX as a sample page, so that we can get an idea of creating a website. After the UI & UX, we started creating the actual website with HTML and CSS. We didn't create any extra CSS files, as we had programmed in-line styles in the HTML pages itself
